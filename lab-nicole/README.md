# vue-demo

This application uses VueJS to render a Hello World application which dynamically updates the page with form field data.

To run the application, go to your terminal and navigate into the lab-nicole folder.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

```

When you serve the app using ```npm run dev```, you can open your browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:8080```.
